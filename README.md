For our ICS 4U1 Computer Science culminating CPT, we present a crossover game of Super Mario Racing, featuring playable Brawl Stars characters. 

In this game, you can choose from two maps and two characters. 

Here are some instructions on how to navigate our game:
1. Before connecting, if you want to play the tutorial press the tutorial button on the menu screen which is only available on single-player modes.
  
2. Racing against friends is available for multi-player once the user connects to a network server (via socket programming) using the "connect" button.
   
3. If you want to host, enter a username and port number in the designated fields then press connect

4. If you want to connect to the host as a client, enter a username and the host's IP address and port number; then press connect.

5. As the host, press the back button then the play button

6. As the host, select a map

7. Host and client selects characters

8. Character movement is conducted entirely through the KeyListener of the direction arrow keys (forward/backward and up for jump).

9. Jump mechanics incorporate a spontaneous gravitational restriction on character's Y vector.

10. Jump mechanics limit the frequency of jump instances in a given interval (specifically, users cannot hold jump infinitely to avoid gravity).

11. You are now ready to play. Have fun!!
